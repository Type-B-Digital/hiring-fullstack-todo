# üìù Full Stack Take-home Assignment ‚Äì TODO App

## üß† Objective

This exercise is intended to evaluate your understanding of full-stack development using your preferred stack.

You‚Äôll build a simple **TODO app** with basic task management functionality, covering both frontend and backend.

---

## üì¶ Tech Stack Requirements

- **Frontend:** React.js
- **Backend:** Node.js with Express.js is preferred. But you may choose your preferred backend technology.
- **Database:** MongoDB or any other Database technologies

You are free to use any UI libraries or tools that improve your productivity.

---

## ‚ú® Features

The app should allow users to:

- ‚úÖ **View TODOs**: Display a list of all TODO items.
- ‚ûï **Create a TODO**: Add a new TODO with a title and optional description.
- ‚úèÔ∏è **Edit a TODO**: Update the title and/or description.
- ‚úÖ **Mark as Done**: Toggle a TODO's `done` status.
- ‚ùå **Delete a TODO**: Remove a TODO item from the list.

## üóÇÔ∏è Recommended Folder Structure

You're free to organize your code as you see fit, but here's a suggested structure:

```
hiring-fullstack-todo/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ client/          # React frontend
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ server/          # Express backend
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md
```

## üõ†Ô∏è API Requirements

Your Express backend should expose the following RESTful API endpoints:

| Method | Endpoint                | Description                      |
|--------|-------------------------|----------------------------------|
| GET    | `/api/todos`            | Get all TODO items               |
| POST   | `/api/todos`            | Create a new TODO item           |
| PUT    | `/api/todos/:id`        | Update a TODO (title/description)|
| PATCH  | `/api/todos/:id/done`   | Toggle the `done` status         |
| DELETE | `/api/todos/:id`        | Delete a TODO                    |

### Database Model Example

```json
{
  "_id": "string",
  "title": "string",
  "description": "string (optional)",
  "done": "boolean",
  "createdAt": "Timestamp",
  "updatedAt": "Timestamp"
}
```

You are encouraged to use **Mongoose** for schema modeling.

## üñºÔ∏è Frontend Expectations

- Display all TODOs in a clean and simple UI
- Provide a form to add new TODOs
- Allow editing a TODO (title/description)
- Provide a way to mark as done/undone (e.g., checkbox, button)
- Add a delete button
- Clearly show completed tasks (e.g., strikethrough or faded style)

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Functional Expectations

- The frontend should talk to the backend via HTTP API
- The backend should persist TODOs in MongoDB
- Handle loading and error states gracefully

**Bonus Points For:**
- Form validation
- User-friendly error messages
- Optimistic UI updates
- Nice touches in UX (e.g., animations, transitions)

## üßæ Submission Instructions

Please follow these steps for submission:

1. **Fork** this repository to your own GitHub account.
2. Create a new branch named `develop` in your fork.
3. Complete the assignment on the `develop` branch.
4. Create a **Pull Request to your own fork** (`develop` ‚Üí `main`).
5. Fill out the provided **PR template**, including:
   - Summary of what you built
   - Solution rationale & user value
   - A short demo video

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Submissions without a properly completed PR template or demo video may not be considered.

## ‚è≥ Time Expectation

This task is expected to take **6‚Äì8 hours**. Please don‚Äôt worry about making it perfect ‚Äî we‚Äôre primarily looking at how you approach full-stack development and structure your solution.

---

## ‚úÖ Evaluation Criteria

- Proper use of chosen stack
- RESTful API structure and usage
- Code readability and organization
- Functional completeness of required features
- Basic UX considerations
- Ability to follow instructions and communicate clearly

---

## üì• README & PR Template Required

Your submission must include:

- `README.md` file for the frontend with iunstructions on how to set up and run the frontend app

  - How to set up and run the backend
  - MongoDB connection notes (e.g., Atlas or local)
  - Any assumptions or limitations
- A completed PR template in your pull request
